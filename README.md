## Plan

Strategic guidance and frameworks to facilitate AI transformation across enterprise leadership personas. These documents help business, technology, and risk leaders identify, evaluate, and prioritize agentic AI use cases that deliver measurable value.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Use Case Discovery Guide**](plan/UseCaseGuidance.md) | 8-step framework for enterprise leaders to identify high-value agentic AI use cases — covers bounded autonomy, measurable outcomes, and governance across industries |

> More strategic planning resources coming soon — persona-specific playbooks (CEO, CIO, CTO, CFO, CRO, CDO), ROI frameworks, and industry-specific adoption guides.

---

## Platform

The AVA Control Plane is a web-based management layer for deploying and operating agent applications on AWS.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Backend**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md) | FastAPI API — template catalog, packaging engine, deployment orchestration, test runner |
| [**Frontend**](platform/control_plane/frontend/README.md) | React + TypeScript UI — browse use cases, deploy with one click, view logs, test agents |
| [**Infrastructure**](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/README.md) | Terraform modules — ECS, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, CloudFront, CodeBuild |
| [**Templates**](platform/docs/templates/README.md) | 8 deployable starter templates — foundations, agent runtimes, and patterns |

### Starter Templates

| Template | Pattern | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Observability Stack | Foundation | Langfuse observability server + OpenTelemetry collector for agent tracing and monitoring |
| Foundation Stack | Foundation | Combined networking (VPC, subnets, security groups) and observability — deploy once per account/region |
| Networking Base | Foundation | VPC, subnets, and security groups for agent deployments |
| Strands AgentCore | Managed Runtime | Strands agent on Bedrock AgentCore with Langfuse observability |
| LangGraph AgentCore | Managed Runtime | LangGraph agent on Bedrock AgentCore with Langfuse observability |
| Tool-Calling Agent | Single Agent | Agent with dynamic tool invocation, registration, and error handling |
| RAG Application | Retrieval | Retrieval-augmented generation with vector search and knowledge base |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | Multi-Agent | Orchestrator pattern with specialized sub-agents collaborating on complex tasks |

[**Deploy the Control Plane &#8594;**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md)

## Applications

### FSI Foundry

34 multi-agent POC implementations spanning 6 FSI domains — all built on one shared foundation of infrastructure and backend code.

- **Direct Amazon Bedrock AgentCore deployment** — simple and quick
- **Two framework implementations per use case** — LangGraph/LangChain and Strands Agents SDK
- **Shared foundations** — adapters, base classes, Terraform modules, Docker configs, agent registry
- **Per-use-case frontend UI** — Each use case has a dedicated React frontend deployed via CloudFront

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) (Claude models enabled)
- AWS CLI >= 2.28.9
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js >= 22
- Docker with buildx support

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/ava
cd ava

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and region
```

**Choose your path:**

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Deploy the Control Plane | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure && ./deploy-full.sh` |
| Deploy an FSI Foundry use case | `cd applications/fsi_foundry && ./scripts/main/deploy.sh` |

> **⚠️ Model Access:** AWS accounts that have not used a legacy model in the last 30 days will receive an error when calling that model, resulting in **"Error: No Response"** in the frontends. Check the Model Catalog to select the right model.
